### \[24\] Creating Policy in DAC Portal - error when saving a minimal draft due to empty values in non-mandatory fields

#### What I tried to do

I tried to create a minimal draft of a Policy in the DAC Portal.
I filled in all mandatory fields and clicked on "CREATE".

#### What I expected to happen

I expected to get some kind of confirmation of the newly created Policy.

#### What actually happened

I was informed "A content or a URL is required", even though these metadata fields are not highlighted as mandatory with a red "wildcard" character.

#### Steps to reproduce the result

1.  Go to the '[DAC Portal](https://dac.ega-archive.org/)' and sign in with your EGA account.
2.  Go to 'My Policies' and click on 'Create a Policy' or click directly on 'Create a Policy' from the roll-down menu from the top right corner.
3.  Fill in all mandatory fields highlighted with a red "wildcard" character.
4.  Click on 'CREATE'
